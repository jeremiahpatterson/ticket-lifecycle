</p>
<p>
From the Windows VM via RDP, open the Admin Helpdesk and End User Support Center. From the End User Center, Click on Open a New Ticket. Enter the required User information, choose a Help Topic, write an Issue Summary and Message, and click Create Ticket.

</p>
<p>
Log in to the Admin Helpdesk using the agent you created during the post configuration. In this example, we used John from the Support department. Click on the ticket. Observe the Priority, Department, Assignment, SLA Plan, and Ticket Thread.
</p>

</p>
<p>
Let's reassign this ticket to the proper department. In this example, we clicked on Assigned To and assigned it to the Online Banking Team. We also clicked on SLA and changed it to Sev-A. We then wrote a message explaining why we reassigned it.

</p>
<p>
In this example, we worked on the ticket and closed it. We logged in as Jane, an admin from the Sys Admin Department. Jane clicked on the Ticket and was able to observe the Priority, Department, Assignment, SLA Plan, and Ticket Thread. After working on the issue with her team, Jane replied with an update on the resolution. She then closed out the ticket by changing the Ticket Status to Resolved and clicking Post Reply.

</p>
<p>
We opened another ticket as another user.

</p>
<p>
This time, Admin Agent John assigned the ticket to himself and changed the SLA Plan. After troubleshooting the issue over the phone with Ken, John addressed the issue and provided a solution in the message box. Then closed the ticket by changing the Ticket Status to Resolved and clicking Post Reply.
